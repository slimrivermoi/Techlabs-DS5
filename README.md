### Our Project Mission
---
Using techniques we have learned in Data Science track to analyze, visualize and create data prediction based on ML model to make positive impacts in data science. 
We have been given 9 datasets (~ 1GB) related to movie and rating data from various sources (TMDB, IMDB, Open Source). At this point, we have yet to determine the specific problem we would like to tackle, the potential prediction target is movie rating prediction.


### Project Phases
---
Project Duration: 9 weeks (July 6 - Sep 1, 2024)

| 1 | Team and project setup | Week 1 | July 14 |
| 2 | Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) | Week 2 | July 21 |
| 3 | data analysis | Week 3-4 | July 28 |
| 4 | Define problem that needs to be solved | Week 4-5 | Aug 5 |
| 5 | Model building and evaluation. | Week 6-7 | Aug 18 |
| 6 | Prepare for Presentation, complete all documentations | Week 8-9 | Sep 1 |

### Detailed Summary of the project (key milestones)
---
July 14:
  - Team setup, received project instructions, GitHub setup, etc.
  - The team set ground rules of engagement, clarify roles, connect Repo and Project on Github.
  - The team meet 2 times a week and use Slack as main communication channel.
  - Mathemetic formula comparisons for movie rating predictions.

July 20:
  - Team met to discuss respective prelim data analysis, data relationship mapping, data parsing and confirmed approach for our EDA (exploratory data analysis).
  - Identify tasks for further EDA to prepare for ML model building.
