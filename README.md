### Our Project Mission:
We have been given 9 datasets (~ 1GB) related to movie and rating data from various sources. At this point, we have yet to determine the specific problem we would like to tackle. Potential prediction targets could be (but not limited to): 
  - Movie ratings
  - Movie profitability
