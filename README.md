#### Detailed Summary of the project (key milestones)
---
July 14:
  - Team setup, received project instructions, GitHub setup, etc.
  - The team set ground rules of engagement, clarify roles, connect Repo and Project on Github.
  - The team meet 2 times a week and use Slack as main communication channel.
  - Mathemetic formula comparisons for movie rating predictions.

July 20:
  - Team met to discuss respective prelim data analysis, data relationship mapping, data parsing and confirmed approach for our EDA (exploratory data analysis).
  - Identify tasks for further EDA to prepare for ML model building.

July 29:
  - Further improvement for file organization and data cleanup procedure in Github.
  - Finalized data cleanup procedure, dataset relationship mapping.
  - Begin exploration in text analysis with various techniques.

Aug 5: 
  - Begin proper Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and basic recommendation system based on non ML model.

Aug 12: 
  - Explore various techniques for model building.
  - techniques include: basic filtering, KNN regression (to predict rating), K-Means Clustering, KNN-classifier, etc.
  - GUI prototype completed.

Aug 19:
  - Basic models in various methods completed. Discussed evaluation and finetuning.
  - Prepare for project submission and presentation.


### Dataset Relationship Mapping
---
- A total of 9 datasets (~ 1GB) related to movie and rating data from various sources (TMDB, IMDB, Open Source) were provided to the team.
- The team analyzed the given dataset and mapped the relationship based on identifiers from each respective files. [Dataset Relationship Mapping](https://github.com/slimrivermoi/Techlabs-DS5/blob/main/edit_data/Lee/Dataset_Relationship_Mapping%2029-07-24.png)
